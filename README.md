# Consumer Behavior and Market Segmentation Analysis

## 1. Problem Statement
The retail business faces challenges in understanding customer purchases, demographics, and shopping preferences. Management currently lacks a clear view of who their most valuable customers are, what drives repeat purchases, and how discounts, product categories, or seasons affect sales performance.

However, the availability of demographic and shopping behavior data presents an opportunity to generate data-driven insights that enable effective customer segmentation. These insights can guide to optimize marketing efforts, develop customer loyalty, and ensure potent sales forecasting.

## 2. Objectives

The objective of this project is to analyze customer demographics and shopping behaviors to uncover the key drivers of sales performance and customer satisfaction. By examining variables such as age, gender, income level, and purchasing patterns, the analysis will identify the most influential factors shaping consumer decisions. Customer loyalty will be measured through indicators including purchase frequency, subscription status, and historical buying trends to understand retention dynamics and long-term value creation.

Furthermore, the project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of promotional strategies by assessing how discounts, promo codes, and shipping options impact purchase amounts and overall engagement. Data visualization techniques will be employed to translate findings into actionable insights that guide strategic marketing, product stocking, and customer retention initiatives. Hypothesis testing will be used to statistically validate observed relationships, while supervised machine learning models will provide predictive insights into customer behavior and future sales trends.
